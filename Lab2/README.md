### Task:
 To develop a application that measures the speed of information transmission via TCP and UDP protocols, as well as the number of lost (distorted) packets. Traffic is generated pseudorandomly (i.e. a pseudorandom data sequence is generated, sent to another computer and there compared with a reference.

1. TCP:

   To check the speed of data transmission via the UDP protocol, you first need to run the server part implemented in the Receiver_UDP2 subdirectory. In the window that appears you need to enter the IP address and the port that will be used for the connection and click on the "Получить" button. Then start the client part, which is located in the subdirectory Sender_UDP2. In the window that appears, enter the information about the IP address, the port of transmission, the number of packages that will be sent to the server and click on "Отправить". After you have done all these operations, the server will display the information about the data transfer rate and the number of the packages delivered.

2. UDP:

    To check the speed of data transmission via the UDP protocol, you first need to run the server part implemented in the Receiver_UDP2 subdirectory. In the window that appears you need to enter the IP address and the port that will be used for the connection and click on the "Получить" button. After that start the client part, which is located in the subdirectory Sender_UDP2. In the window that appears, enter the information about the IP address, the port of transmission, the number of packages that will be sent to the server and click on "Отправить". After you have done all these operations, the server will display the information about the data transfer rate and the number of the packages delivered.
